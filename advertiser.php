                <p>Our Technology resolved the mystery and doubts around “VIEWABILITY”, where advertisers have no clue of the real rate of views of their banner ads. Ads Factory provides this data, as the number of pops, which provides the unique ability to do optimizations during the campaign.</p>

                <p>Publishers & advertisers have complete control of both the level of Viewability and the level of intrusiveness of the ads. They can choose any degree of Viewability ranging from the hidden in-image ad, to auto pop where the ad pops up upon page load and any level in between through degrees of ad overlays</p>
